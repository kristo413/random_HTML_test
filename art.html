      I will attempt to use this page as an exhibition for NFT art pieces that I
      have collected over time. The page may not always display the most up to
      date collection represented by the Stinehart NFT Vault. A more up to date
      collection can be viewed on OpenSea.

    <div>
      <!-- Similar to the gallery page, I would hope to use a cool border around each NFT peice. Either in a cool frame or fun border to go along with the background. -->
